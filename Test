Business Impact
•	What type of fix/upgrade/etc. is being performed?
•	Please elaborate which module(s) within the application(s) will be impacted?
•	What will be the end user impact during deployment time?	This is a full upgrade of the Aldera platform (Core and Portal). 

Answer There are different enhancements along with additional production support fixes included in this release. This is a very large number of changes both on the Core and Portal side. This affects the entire Aldera environment. This will require downtime for clients from 5:00 AM CST on Sunday 10/22/2023 until release is signed off on by validation teams. For DQVIS the downtime will require around 9:00 PM CST on Saturday 08/05/2023.Goal is to have the deployment completed by 9:00 AM CST on Sunday 08/06/2023 and validation complete by 1:00 PM Sunday. For DQVIS is to have the deployment completed by 10:00 PM CST and validation complete by 11:00 PM CST.
