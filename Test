Hello Team,

Below mentioned test is failing across all the UAT environment tests including SAAS clients.Please refer the attached screenshot.I know the above failure is because of AVS migration in UAT environment, As UAT its completely moved to AVS we need to change some configuration in Jenkins Job and Environment Test (JSON File). Can you please provide me the values which we need to add in JSON file. I have added the below values and tested in one of the client It says Folder value should be in discovered virtual machine, Can you please confirm the values below and please provide the incorrect values.
