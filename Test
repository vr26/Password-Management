Team,

General Update - Moving forward, we will be utilizing the "RMTasks" label in our tickets for various non-deployment related tasks within RM. Examples of such tasks include Environment Refresh Activities, Troubleshooting Activities, Update Keys/Config Tickets, and any other tickets that are unrelated to deployment activities. By implementing this label, we aim to simplify the process of tracking Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) for our deployment-related tasks. It's important to note that tasks categorized as "RMTasks" often require more time for resolution, which can impact our MTTR metrics. We kindly request everyone's cooperation in adopting this label going forward. If you have any questions or need clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out. We have already applied the new labels to existing backlog tickets in our RM resolver group.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
