Team,

General Update - We will be using "RMTasks" labels here onwards in tickets for general tasks which we are doing in RM, Example Environment Refresh Activity Ticket, Troubleshooting Activity Ticket, Update Keys/Config Tickets, Any other tickets which is not releted to deployment. by using we can easily filter the MTTR for deployments as General tasks which needs more time for resolution it affects out MTTR. Hope everyone understands. please try to use RMTasks here after. Let me know if you have any questions. i have updated the new labels in existing backlog tickets in our RM resolver group
