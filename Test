I am taking over the task of code set governance which has been a very manual process in many ways. I came from API/Hl7/etc. driven updates where I collaborated with tech team to give the criteria and they built it. So, I am not well versed on how to do this.  and in need to create an easy, automated way to check for items that need ACTION (ADD, MODIFY, DELETE) in Aldera.
I've managed to transform all the tables FROM Optum (Source of truth - via SFTP) and Aldera spaces (vai SQL query connection), as needed, but now I need a comparison between them. This is driven by a few parameters:
TABLE 1 -- Source of truth (single version for each update)
Columns 1-5 are ALWAYS used in all environments.
This is compared with TABLE 2 (multiple variations/environments based on client for each update)
TABLE 2-- Aldera data (this data can be manually modified by users)
Columns 1-5 (when different) need to be populated with TABLE 1 data and flagged for action.
End results is: When COLUMN 1 or COLUMN 2 or COLUMN 3 or COLUMN 4 or COLUMN 5 are a mismatch, then show on merged output.
ADD Rows (no match in Table 2)
MODIFY Rows (partial match – Column 2 matches, another column 1,3,4, or 5 does not)
DELETE Rows (no match in Table 1)
Rows with no change are not needed in the output because they are a match and no action needed (I can filter these out later if easier to keep them in the merge)
This has to be repeated with TABLE 1 compared to each TABLE 2 by client. I know how to 'copy' advanced editor to repeat steps, but I have no idea how to achieve the first one, so If I can just get one done, I can take it from there.
 
I've read several, several post, videos, articles, etc. and once again, I am not finding a standard formula/code for this type of comparison. Seems like there would be for such a common task.
 
FINAL CODE SHOULD SAY
 
The merged output should be based on when COLUMN 1 (primary key), COLUMN 2, COLUMN 3, COLUMN 4, or COLUMN 5 do not match. Any row in Table 1 that has different values in any of these columns compared to the corresponding row in Table 2 should be considered a mismatch.
 
To identify the action for each mismatched line, Seems I may need to create a conditional column to Identify the Action for Each Mismatched Line. Ultimately, this is to POPULATE the value in {Action} column
Here is an example (I don't know M code well, so this code doesn't work, but I hope it helps explain what I want)
Action = IF(ISBLANK([Table 2: COL 1, COL 2, COL 3, COL 4, COL 5]),"ADD", ""
and
Action = IF(ISBLANK([Table 1: COL 1, COL 2, COL 3, COL 4, COL 5]),"DELETE", ""
and 
Action = IF([Action] = "" & [Table 2: COL 1 or COL 2 or COL 3 or COL 4 or COL 5]><[Table 2: COL 1 or COL 2 or COL 3 or COL 4 or COL 5]),"MODIFY", "No Change"
"No Change" should technically not occur, because the merge should only have rows that mismatch – unless this is not possible.
This formula is intended to return Add if the corresponding column 1-5 rows in Table 2 are blank (no match in table 2) and return DELETE if the corresponding column 1-5 rows in Table 1 are blank (no match in table 1). Then, when action is not ADD or DELETE (it is [blank]) and any of the columns from one table are not equal to the other, return Modify (only a partial match).
 
All of the columns for each table are listed below. Note that Column 2, {Product ID}, is the common primary key):
The blue columns of each table should always match in both and the sole purpose of the merge to check these 5 values. When any of the 5 values is a mismatch, Table 1 is the value to populate into table 2.
The red columns only exist in table 2 as they hold the specific keys, version, etc. within the software database and will be blank for 'ADD' and populated for DELETE or MODIFY.
Table 1: {"Product_qualifier", "Product_id", "Product_name", "effective_date", "termination_date"}
Table 2: {"Product_qualifier", "Product_id", "Product_name", "effective_date", "termination_date", "default_class", "incentive_flag", "generic_product_id", "generic_name", "manufacturer_id", "manufacturer_name", "generic_code", "DEA_class_code", "Therapeutic_class_code", "Therapeutic_equiv_code", "RX_OTC_indicator", "third_party_rest_code", "GPPC_code", "metric_strength", "strength_UOM", "dosage_form", "package_size", "package_UOM", "package_QTY", "total_package_QTY", "legend_change_date", "DESI_code", "maintenance_drug_code", "dispensing_unit_code", "unit_dose_code", "route_admin_code", "form_type_code", "dollar_rank_code", "RX_rank_code", "single_comb_code", "repackager_IND", "product_id.1", "product_name.1", "product_id2", "product_name2", "last_change_date", "drug_status", "int_EXT_Code", "package_description", "OTC_EQUIV_IND", "stc_code", "gcn_code", "HICL_SeqNo", "GTC_Code", "HIC3_Code", "Quadrant_Req", "Tooth_Req", "Surface_Req", "tooth_type", "Auto_Adjudicate", "Clinical_Doc", "Credentialling_Req", "color_code", "hist_multiplier", "min_num_surfaces", "max_num_surfaces", "Time_Units", "asc_grouper", "apc_classification", "base_units", "Default_Unit_Basis", "RoomAndBoardCharges", "Action", "Entity", "Key_1", "Key_2", "Key_3", "Key_4", "Key_5", "Key_6", "Key_7", "Key_8", "Key_9", "Key_10", "DateTimeModified"},
