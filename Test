o request the setup of a basic version of Power Automate for our IT Service Management (ITSM) team, specifically for the email address ITSMserviceManagement@evolent.com. This email address functions as a mailbox for our team's communication needs.

Our objective is to send Emergency Change Advisory Board (ECAB) notifications via Teams using Power Automate. These notifications will serve as mid-level reminders, with alerts sent out at 30-minute and 45-minute intervals. To achieve this, we intend to leverage the newly created ITSM mailbox email for streamlined communication and efficiency.

I kindly request your assistance in setting up this Power Automate workflow or exploring alternative solutions, if any, to achieve our goal effectively. Your support in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention and prompt action on this request. Please feel free to reach out if you need any additional information or clarification.
