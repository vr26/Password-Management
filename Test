Hi Team,
Request to have basic version of power automate for ITSMserviceManagement@evolent.com, ITSMserviceManagement@evolent.com (This is a mailbox).
We plan to send ecab notifications in Teams via power automate to act as a mid level notification for instant 30minutes and 45 minutes reminder. We plan to utilize the newly created ITSM mailbox email for this, let me know if we can utilize new mailbox or do we have any other resolutions to get this done.
